# tmdb-api-nodejs
----
This is an API for TMDB. The app and website that I will build will be able to connect to this endpoint hopefully with an authenticated token and send/ receive data.

## Install
* clone repository
* npm install to install node modules
* npm test to run tests
* npm run start to start the app
* API lives on http://localhost:3000
----
## TO-DO
* Implement authenticated token for sending and getting a request from the server.
* add to collection? ```account/collection/:id ``` - this would need user data registering... maybe something to look at.
